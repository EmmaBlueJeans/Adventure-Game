# Adventure-Game
Flutter MidTerm - part 1 of the Game:
Download sample code - Once you have the sample, then make the proper edits...
  Make a map that has six rooms
  Create buttons for movement. You just need to have North, South, East, and West
  Only show the buttons where there is a room
For example, if I am in the Kitchen of a castle, and there are two exits East and West, then you should only show those buttons
  Add an exit button for the application
  Add text descriptions for each room
  Make sure the user can move around smoothly and then exit the game
